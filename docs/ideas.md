# Innovative Idea

**Passage** is a web-based application that students in any of the Five Colleges can use to pass on course textbooks (or other books) to other students in the area. The website is similar to Craigslist, but verifies that the sellers and buyers are indeed students at one of the Five Colleges, and also provides an in-app messaging feature for greater convenience and confidentiality. Potential buyers can message sellers through the app, and arrange to meet up and exchange the books and payments. The application will also incorporate a rating system where the users can rate each other based on their transaction satisfaction

# Important Components

* ### Search Bar
    Allow users to search for currently available books by title, course number, author, and so on.
* ### Post a Book for Sale
    Sellers upload a book for sale with information like selling price, author, textbook/non-textbook, course where the book was used, optional book cover, and so on.
* ### Contact Sellers
    Once a buyer has found the desired book, he/she can message the seller using the in-app chat feature and decide upon whether to buy the book or not, negotiate, where to meet, how to exchange payments, and so on.
* ### Report and Rate Transaction
    When a book has been sold, both the buyer and seller are expected to report the transaction. Buyers and sellers can rate each other based on their satisfaction with the transaction. Even if one of them reports the transaction, the other will be reminded via email.
