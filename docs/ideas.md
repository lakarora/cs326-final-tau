# Innovative Idea

**Passage** is a web-based application that students in any of the Five Colleges can use to pass on course textbooks (or other books) to other students in the area. The website is similar to Craigslist, but verifies that the sellers and buyers are indeed students at one of the Five Colleges, and also provides an in-app messaging feature for greater convenience and confidentiality. Potential buyers can message sellers through the app, and arrange to meet up and exchange the books and payments. The application will also incorporate a rating system where the users can rate each other based on their transaction satisfaction
