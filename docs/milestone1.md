# Innovative Idea

**Passage** is a web-based application that students in any of the Five Colleges can use to pass on course textbooks (or other books) to other students in the area. The website is similar to Craigslist, but verifies that the sellers and buyers are indeed students at one of the Five Colleges, and also provides an in-app messaging feature for greater convenience and confidentiality. Potential buyers can message sellers through the app, and arrange to meet up and exchange the books and payments. The application will also incorporate a rating system where the users can rate each other based on their transaction satisfaction. Users can also compare the books on the website to those on Amazon so that they know if they are getting a deal. 

# Important Components

* ### Search Bar
    Allow users to search for currently available books by title, course number, author, and so on.
* ### Post a Book for Sale
    Sellers upload a book for sale with information like selling price, author, textbook/non-textbook, course where the book was used, optional book cover, and so on.
* ### Contact Sellers
    Once a buyer has found the desired book, he/she can message the seller using the in-app chat feature and decide upon whether to buy the book or not, negotiate, where to meet, how to exchange payments, and so on.
* ### Report and Rate Transaction
    When a book has been sold, both the buyer and seller are expected to report the transaction. Buyers and sellers can rate each other based on their satisfaction with the transaction. Even if one of them reports the transaction, the other will be reminded via email. 
* ### Price Comparison
    Both sellers and buyers will be able to see the price of the book on Amazon so that they can make a more educated trade. Based off of the books condition we will also change the valuation so that people can know what they should be getting/paying for the book.

# Important Data

* User information such as full name, email address, username, password, institution and ratings provided by other users.
* Books posted by users for sale with their ISBN, course number, author, and so on.
* The messages between different users.

# Work Breakdown
* Lakshay Arora - [lakarora](https://github.com/lakarora): Created popups for rating other users and account verification using OTP. Also created pages for creating a new account, a page to search users, a page to rate and view other users, and a page for displaying options after a successful login. 
* Nishad Ranade - [nishadranade](https://github.com/nishadranade): Created the account information page, page to post a book to the website, and the book search page. Added folders for website resources for better organization. Fixed positioning of elements on the search results page.
* Nathan Grant - [N8Grant](https://github.com/N8Grant): Created the home page aka. index.html and searchResults.html for displaying relavent books. Also created the messages.html for users to communicate and included a menu list for navigating all of the different user options.

There are a total of 36 commits, out of which Nathan did 14 commits (not recorded in insights page), Lakshay Arora did 14 commits (7 recorded, rest are not), and Nishad Ranade did 8 commits. However, all three of us acknowlegde that the work split was equal and the difference in number of commits is due to minor changes like fixing file structure, gitignore, etc.
